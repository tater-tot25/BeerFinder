Welcome to BeerFinder!!!!

Dependencies: psycopg2

Usage Guide:

-Navigate to directory and run: directory/python3 -m beerFinder [-h] [-l] [results] [query] [value]

Notes:

None of the current data is real, all of it is generated by chatGPT, this is a proof of concept.
There is currently no accounts, and it is super easy to destroy this entire database, given that the password
is in the beerFinder.py file, so please be cool and don't do that!

Thanks for checking this out!
